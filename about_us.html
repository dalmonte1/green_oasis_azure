            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p class="justify">Green Oasis was founded in 2005 by a group of passionate environmentalists and coffee enthusiasts. The idea behind the cafe was to create a space that not only served great coffee and food but also provided a serene environment filled with greenery and plants.</p>
            <p class="justify">Initially starting as a small coffee shop, Green Oasis quickly gained popularity among students and workers in the area who were looking for a relaxing spot to unwind and enjoy quality beverages. As the demand grew, the cafe expanded its offerings and space, transforming into a full-fledged hangout spot.</p>

            <p class="justify">Over the years, Green Oasis has remained committed to its founding principles of sustainability and community. The cafe sources its coffee beans from ethically and environmentally responsible sources, and strives to minimize its ecological footprint through initiatives such as recycling and composting.</p>
            <p class="justify">Today, Green Oasis continues to be a beloved destination for coffee and nature lovers alike. With its cozy ambiance, lush greenery, and welcoming atmosphere, it serves as a haven for those seeking refuge from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p>
